3. Graph
   You can see your expense amounts daily, weekly and monthly based on the tags
3. Limit
   You can configure daily, weekly and monthly limits and get feedback if you exceed the limit

## :question: How To Use
  Adding expense can be tricky but not that diffucult.
 ### :bookmark: How To Add Tags
  You just need to add . or # before the tag's name. For example, .travel #food
